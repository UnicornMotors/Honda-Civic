Introduced in September 1991 for the 1992 model year, the redesigned Civic featured increased dimensions, as well as more aerodynamic styling. The wagon variant was now only available in the Japanese market where the previous generation wagon was carried over until 1995. The efficiency of the previous HF model was replaced by the VX hatchback which, with an EPA rating of 48 / 55 miles per US gallon (4.9 / 4.3 L/100 km; 58 / 66 mpg‑imp), was Honda's most fuel efficient model sold at the time.
